Orkut : Some of you may be knowing about this but this one is for those who don't..
It was (i wrote 'was' Because Orkut Got Shut down  in 2014 )a Social media  From Google But originally made by  Orkut BÃ¼yÃ¼kkÃ¶kten as individuals project  while working on Google as Engineer .
In Orkut messaging friends was done : via the scrapbook or by sending a private message. Scrapbook is like Follower More you Have More You are Famous .
Pages you know in Facebook were called as Community in Orkut !!

Now lets Start</p>

I joined Orkut and Soon became addicted To it -
Sending Scraps All the time ðŸ˜‚ to get more and more scraps.
This was the time when i started copying the image link and sent it to friend's scrapbook !!!
To gather New Scraps I started visiting  website Which features scraps for Orkut !!
And some website are still live(Check out www.scrap9.com) as I visted more and more site,
I observed a unique Way to Scraps there are lines of  words  (Code) which you just have to copy and
paste on your friends Scrapbook.</p>

Exam Time  âœŒ
After 2 month  when I came back  I used  some image link scraps and  code scraps !
soon  I started Joining communities to gather more and more Scraps.
There were millions of scrap communities with millions of active member,
where I got some new friends from Brazil, India !!
Soon after that I noticed that some of the scraps that I did post to my friends profile yielded reply with
the same scraps but with some differences like color and size.
Soon that I asked my Friend about how were they able to alter scrap's property,
they answered me that code Scraps  can be altered  You Just  Have To increase the no.
 Where you see 'font-size=' and name a color in 'color=' Haha Funny  !! ( Yes this is html )

As Time goes I had about 20k Scraps in my profile !! We started experimenting these codes but never google about it!! (I wish if I did) One day, me and Some of My friends  Decided to make a Scrapbook community !!
Where we usually Gather Scraps from many different  communities and edit its font-size , color, text, and background. Eventually, after a month of hard work ( Copy /paste ) we had about 5k members  and 2.3k active members !!  And at that time I had about 100k scraps - and little popular as we were the onwer Of a 5k member Community ðŸ˜‚</p>

I got offine for 1.5 month (vacation &  health issues ) soon I came back I was shocked my friends  Have
about 300k + Scraps ðŸ˜±  Awww  !!
I Texted them many time, waiting curiously.
After 1 or 2 hours they came online and said they have a trick to send scraps to all my friends in one click !!
 I was shocked OMG How did you Do That -

They Gave me the Code and we had a Pact of no sharing to anyone elseðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
About 3-5  months after that, we had about 700k Scraps and  our community had about 300k + members !!</p>

One Fine day in Hostel - I was in Class Room busy with my studies !!
Suddenly a 1 fresher student entered and sat beside me with an IT Book and a note in hand !!
After some time I just grabbed his book to see contents as I love IT and
